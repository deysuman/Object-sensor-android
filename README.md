# Android Object-sensor with tensorflow mobile
This android application uses Object-sensor model for object detection. It uses tensorflow mobile to run neural networks. I would like to use tensorflow lite later. Probably, it is the first open source implementation of the second version of YOLO for Tensorflow on Android device. The demo application detects 20 classes of Pascal VOC dataset.
